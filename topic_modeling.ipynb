', 'ment in this study ', 'Control and commitment represent two distinct approaches to shaping ', 'employee behaviors and attitudes at work The goal of control human re ', 'source systems is to reduce

Walton In contrast commitment human resource systems ', 'shape desired employee behaviors and attitudes by forging psychological ', 'links between organizational and employee goals In other words the

'that control and commitment represent conceptually distinct ideal systems ', 'and that any deviation from the ideal types will weaken performance Al ', 'ternatively control and commitment can be conceptualized as the opposite ', 'ends of a continuum of possible human resource systems and the most ', 'effective system seen as existing somewhere between the two extremes ', 'Empirical tests are

example because of sample size limitations I ', 'was unable in this study to test for the performance effects of the fit between ', 'business strategy and human resource strategy Finally there is a need to ', 'demonstrate that certain combinations of human resource programs poli ', 'cies and practices lead to specific employee attitudes such as trust in man ', 'agement or organizational commitment that in turn lead to specific em ', 'ployee behaviors beneficial to effectively ', 'implementing a given business ', 'strategy Exploring these intermediate links explicitly will undoubtedly
